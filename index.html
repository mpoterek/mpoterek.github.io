	<h2>PhD Student, University of Notre Dame</h2>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame.
		I'm a member of the Perkins lab, which applies computational approaches to answer questions 
		about the ecology and epidemiology of infectious diseases.</p>
	<p>I am particularly interested in analyzing the role of human behavior and communications in the spread of infectious disease. 
		Fear of disease, particularly of an illness that is notably severe or contagious, can spread farther and faster than the 
		disease itself and lead to adaptive, often self-isolating behaviors that can change the course of an outbreak, as we are 
		now observing in real time during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, an understanding of how disease-related information 
		is disseminated and how it impacts human behavior can meaningfully inform pathogen transmission models and inform optimal 
		intervention strategies.</p>

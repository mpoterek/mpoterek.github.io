	<h2>PhD Student, University of Notre Dame</h2>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in the <li><a href="https://biology.nd.edu/">Department of Biological Sciences</a></li>at the University of 
		Notre Dame, where I am a member of the <li><a href="http://perkinslab.weebly.com/">Perkins Lab</a></li>. Research in the
		Perkins Lab applies computational approaches to answer questions about the ecology and epidemiology of infectious 
		diseases.</p>
	<p>I am particularly interested in analyzing the role of human behavior and communications in the spread of infectious disease. 
		Fear of disease, particularly of an illness that is notably severe or contagious, can spread farther and faster than the 
		disease itself and lead to adaptive, often self-isolating behaviors that can change the course of an outbreak, as we are 
		now observing in real time during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, an understanding of how disease-related information 
		is disseminated and how it impacts human behavior can meaningfully inform pathogen transmission models and inform optimal 
		intervention strategies.</p>
	<p>I am also excited by the use of nontraditional data and network approaches in mathematical models. Network-centric approaches to 
		epidemiology are a powerful way to incorporate population interactions into models of infectious disease, and as social 
		media and cyber-physical system data become increasingly available, I hope to take advantage of the unique insights they can 
		provide into human behavior.
